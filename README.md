# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise recently wrapped up a kickstarter campaign for her play, ‘Fever’. It unfortunately fell just short of goal. As part of a retrospect, Louise has provided me with a sample of historical kickstarter campaign to analyse. She is particularly interested in how campaign performed differed or didn’t based on launch date and funding goals.

### Purpose

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
