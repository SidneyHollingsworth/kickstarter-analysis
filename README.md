# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Louise recently wrapped up a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for her play, ‘Fever’. It unfortunately fell just short of goal. As part of her retrospect, Louise has come to me providing me with an excel file containing historical kickstarter campaign data to analyse.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to glean characteristics of kickstar campaigns. Louise is particularly interested in how campaigns performed by launch date and funding goals.

#### Overview of Analysis: 

- I used excel to manipulate, visualize, and analyze provided data with the end goal of answering Louise's key questions and further, providing her with actionable insights she can use when designing future kickstarter campaigns.
- The provided dataset included more information than needed. Lots of different types of campaigns. Best to filter data and analysis to Theater Parent Catergory and Play Sub Category.
- First had to manipulate and filter data. Data manipulation included splitting text and time stamp conversion.
- To best address Louise's key questions, I created two pivots then line charts for visualization to better identify trends

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

## Results

#### Conclusions: Outcomes based on Launch Date

- Theater campaigns launched during the months of May and June performed best while theater campaigns launched during the months of November and December performed worst.
- 

#### Conclusion: Outcomes based on Goals

- 

#### Challenges Encountered: 
 
- Difficulties encountered when performing my analysis included human error, namely typos in my excel formulas, and having to convert [name timestamp] to data type more manageable. Human error was overcome by very carefully reviewing all formulas. To convert [name timestamp], I used [formula].[how they were overcome.]

### Dataset limitations

- This project was particularly challenging to me as per the many unknowns; my analysis assumes quality and tactics of all campaigns held equal.
- Small sample size amongst campaigns with larger goal. For example, there were x campaigns with a goal between x and y and z campaigns greater than v.
- Assumption made about different currencies; not sure if goal and outcome data was already converted to dollars
- Outcome of campaigns categorical rather than analysized by difference of pledged from goal

#### Recommended Further Analysis

- [possible tables and/or graphs that we could create]
