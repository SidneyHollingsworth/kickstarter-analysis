# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise recently wrapped up a kickstarter campaign for her play, ‘Fever’. Unfortunately, it fell just short of goal. As part of a retrospect, they have provided me with a sample of historical kickstarter campaigns to analyse. Louise is particularly interested in how campaign performed differed or didn’t based on launch date and funding goals.

### Purpose
In order to glean characteristics of historic successful crowdfunding campaigns, I used excel to clean, filter, and analyze provided crowdfunding data with the end goal of providing Louise with actionable insights they can keep in mind when designing future kickstarter campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
