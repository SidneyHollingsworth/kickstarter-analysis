# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Louise recently wrapped up a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for her play, ‘Fever’. It unfortunately fell just short of goal. As part of her retrospect, Louise has come to me providing me with an excel file containing historical kickstarter campaign data to analyse.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to glean characteristics of sucessful kickstar campaigns. Louise is particularly interested in how campaigns performed by launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

I used excel to clean, filter, visualize, and analyze provided data with the end goal of answering Louise's key questions and further, providing her with actionable insights she can use when designing future kickstarter campaigns.

#### About Dataset

- The provided dataset included more info than needed.
- 4114 Kickstart campaigns
- 9 categories and 41 Subcategories
- Of the 1,393 Theater campaigns, 1,066 were plays. 

#### Overview of Analysis: 

- First had to manipulate and filter data. Data manipulation included splitting text of provided 'Category' column to seperate Parent Category and Sub Category.
- Created pivots then line charts for visualization to better identify trends
- Filtered to better address Louise's curiousity.

#### Challenges Encountered: 
 
- I encountered challenges when performing my analysis. Such difficulties included human error, namely typos in my excel formulas, and having to convert [name timestamp] to data type more manageable. [how they were overcome.]

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

## Results

#### Conclusions: Outcomes based on Launch Date

- May and June Theater launches performed best.
-

#### Conclusion: Outcomes based on Goals

- 

#### Dataset limitations

- Small sample size amongst campaigns with larger goal. For example, there were x campaigns with a goal between x and y and z campaigns greater than v.
- Many unknowns; analysis assumes quality and tactics of all campaigns held equal
- different currencies; not sure if goal and outcome data was already converted to dollars
- Outcome of campaigns categorical rather than analysized by difference of pledged from goal

#### Further Analysis

- [possible tables and/or graphs that we could create]
